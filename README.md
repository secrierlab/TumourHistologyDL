## Introduction
Tumour immunity is key for the prognosis and treatment of colon adenocarcinoma, but its characterisation remains cumbersome and expensive, requiring sequencing or other complex assays. Detecting tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides of cancer tissue would provide a cost-effective alternative to support clinicians in treatment decisions, but inter- and intra-observer variability can arise even amongst experienced pathologists when assessing a sample. Furthermore, the compounded effect of other cells in the tumour microenvironment is challenging to quantify but could yield useful additional biomarkers.

## Predicting the Immunescore level and presence of cells
- Tech 1 - version 1.0
- Tech 2 - version 2.0
- Tech 3 - version 3.0


## Graph analysis
You can explore our database following the next steps:
-  download a copy of our database [here](https://secrierlab.github.io/projects/). It is a zip file including all the necessary files.
-  You will need an operational version of the Neo4j software running in your computer. We have used the open source version [Neo4j Community Edition](https://neo4j.com/download-center/#community).
-  Ensure the system service is not running on your machine. In Linux:
<pre><code> sudo systemctl stop neo4j.service </pre></code>
-  Unzip the same graph.db.zip into the appropriate database folder. <neo4j-home>/data
- Restart the Neo4j system service

sudo systemctl start neo4j.service
sudo systemctl enable neo4j.service
sudo systemctl status neo4j.service
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/lib/neo4j/data/databases/coad
vim /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
dbms.active_database = coad.db


You can  For tis work we used . Once you have downloaded a copy of database and installed Neo4j in your computer, to explore our databse you can simply copy the image of the databse to the folder your Neo4J data is stored.
