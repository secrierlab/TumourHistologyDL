## Introduction
Tumour immunity is key for the prognosis and treatment of colon adenocarcinoma, but its characterisation remains cumbersome and expensive, requiring sequencing or other complex assays. Detecting tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes in haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides of cancer tissue would provide a cost-effective alternative to support clinicians in treatment decisions, but inter- and intra-observer variability can arise even amongst experienced pathologists when assessing a sample. Furthermore, the compounded effect of other cells in the tumour microenvironment is challenging to quantify but could yield useful additional biomarkers.
